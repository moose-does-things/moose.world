<p class="story"> A new year! woah! Lowkey haven't been updating this for a while...I been busy, okay? Exam results are as expected, now I just have to get into uni - and then there's the whole seperate problem of paying for it. Hopes are high, nonetheless. These past few weeks have been jampacked with activity after hangout after this-will-make-a-great-story-someday events. For legal reasons I'll add a few tidbits of the past few weeks since exams officially ended:
<br></br> 1. Never drinking raspberry cruisers again; they stain my mouth bright red and it is not a pretty sight.
<br></br> 2. Not being able to piss in the only public bathroom open at 3 AM in a small town because of 4 aussie preteens smoking weed and starting multiple toilet fires.
<br></br> 3. Got the wordle on the second try, all grey for the first. fuck yeah. 
<br></br> 4. Set the highscore on 2 arcade games and hit probably over 20 jackpots. 
<br></br> 5. Drunken Mcdonalds
<br></br> 6. Almost caught by a combine harvester. terrifying. 
<br></br> 7. A $200 jacket containing car keys and wallet lost in kmart. found 30 mins after the fact.
<br></br> 8. My hair is now black with blondebrown front pieces and my right (your left) eyebrow has jewellery through it.
<br></br> 9. More drunken Mcdonalds
<br></br> Might not actually be that interesting without the full stories, but I'm having the time of life; cest la vie I guess.

<p class="story"> Macademy's! Holy Shit! It was hot as balls in there, but who cares when things go so good! I got awarded Best Production Design and Best Director - the first and last of the non-speech awards. I was so fucking happy but what really put the cherry on the icing was when I got pulled aside as a judge - an industry professional! - wanted to personally tell me he loved my directing, that he thinks I'm above many he's seen who has had way more training and education. Tooting my own horn just a bit - toot toot! - because that's crazy and such a confidence boost and good omen for what's to come. My media teacher also reportedly said "*film name* was technically good but what Maegan made was art" and well howdy if I don't faint right here on the spot!

<p class="story"> Had my last ever high-school drama performance last night. It went way better than any of the rehearsals which is good, it got a good amount of laughs. Probably the last performance I'll ever really do - at least from my current perspective. Macademy's is tomorrow. Here's to hoping I win something, anything! I'm hoping to win a technical or individual award for On Screen; Best Producer would be so so good espcially as my production work is getting complimented the most in all the feedback so far.

<p class="story"> Currently in school. This ho sucks (the ho being english class). I couldn't fall asleep until like 3:30 AM last night so I gots a fat headache. Tristan has tetris on his calculator and it is the best thing besides the kandi beaded lizard I made yesterday. His name is Goopy and he is life.

<p class="story"> School holidays! Woah! The last school holidays ever actually. The party on Saturday was animal themed, and I went as a moth - partially inspired by mothman. It was so fun, but I kept getting stuck on shit with the wings and antennae so it was pictures, and then that shit came off quick.

My dad bought a special edition Fanta thats 'chucky's punch' flavour. He thinks its nasty. I think it just tastes like the Raspberry shweppes drinks you get. Maybe my horror-fan-ness is subconciously influenceing me? Probably not. The watermelon Mountain Dew is awful.

<p class="story"> No school tomorrow cause of exam leave, yippee! I have so far managed to get all my moose.world pages up and running with the basics - titles, buttons, stylisticly what I want - even though I had to redo (modern baseball reference) like all of nerdville and the library cause they lowk broke. But they're all goods now! 
<br></br> 
Me and my brother went to an Evil Dead marathon yesterday. It was the OG trilogy and it was really fun getting to rewatch them all - hail to the king, baby! Producer Robert Tapert was there and he told wacky stories of the making of the three films, including some side rants about Hard Target and Van Damme. On a totally unrelated note I'm in a Van Damme mood now and might go on a rampage watching some of his movies. I mean, I already love Bloodsport.
